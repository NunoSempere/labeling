# labeling [![](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/labeling)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=labeling)

This package contains functions which provide a range of axis labeling algorithms, most notably the "extended" algorithm described in Talbot et al.'s [An Extension of Wilkinsonâ€™s Algorithm for Positioning Tick Labels on Axes](http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2010-TickLabels-InfoVis.pdf). They are used in [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), through the [scales](https://scales.r-lib.org/) package.
